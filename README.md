# Arduino RGB Lamp
An Arduino project for driving RGB LEDs.

My daughter likes the "rainbow lights" at our local electronics store:
RGB LEDs that cycle through a range of colors. Rather than buy the
ready-made controls, I decided to drive it off an Arduino so that I could
make whatever programs I want, make it accessible via phone, and so forth.

This is the program for the project.
